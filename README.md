# 🚨 911 Calls Capstone Project – Emergency Response Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a real-world dataset of **911 emergency calls** from Kaggle. The goal is to apply Python and data analysis techniques to extract insights about the nature, location, and frequency of emergency incidents.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information such as:
- 📍 **Location** (Latitude, Longitude, Zip Code)
- 🆘 **Call Type and Description**
- 🕒 **Time Stamps** (date and time of the call)
- 🗺️ **Township**
- 📬 **Address**
- 🚨 **Title** (emergency category)
- 🔘 **Dummy variable** (indicating presence of traffic)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the most common types of 911 calls
- Analyze call volume over time (hour, day, month)
- Visualize data by location and emergency type
- Create interactive plots to explore patterns
- Practice data wrangling, time-series analysis, and visualization

## 📌 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
*(Insert example chart screenshots here if you want)*

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
